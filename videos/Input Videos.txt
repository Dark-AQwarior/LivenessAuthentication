videos is our input folder which we are going to give to the model to train it.

Create a video of yourself, walking around your space for 20-30 seconds. 
Store it inside this folder with a name real.mp4.

Then, hold the real.mp4 folder against your laptop/computer's camera (do not show your real face to cam)
Record another video in the above manner. Save it in this same folder with a name fake.mp4
